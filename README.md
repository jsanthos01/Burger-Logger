# Burger-Logger

This is a mini burger logger application that uses MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). MySQL is used to query and route data in this app. I have not tried handlebars yet. But a new version will soon be coming out !!!

## Installations

```
* npm init 
* npm i express
* npm i mysql
