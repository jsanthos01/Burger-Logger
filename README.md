# Burger-Logger

Burger Logger is an application created with MySQL, Node and Express. User creates a burger by entering its name into the text field. Once the user submits the burger's name, it is stored in the database as an object and waiting to be devoured. The user can also view all the items in the database, change the status of the item (devoured or not devoured), and delete an item from a database. The app is based on the concept of CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Delete). Node/Express is used for the server and routing.
